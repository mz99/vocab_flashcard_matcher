# Difference between edit and update is the edit action displays view for the edit page,
# while the update action is when you send a post request.
# new -> create (new brings you to the view, create does the actual changing)
# edit -> update (edit brings you to the view, update does the actual changing)
# For CRUD, only use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Patch/HEAD/CONNECT/OPTIONS should be ignored and thought of as POST.
